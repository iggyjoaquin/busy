- the ins and outs of developing a single page application with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
- using Node.js as a build tool.
- using npm modules to organize code.
- using other tools minify and concatenate code for deployment.

Run using:
- `$ npm run dev` for developing
- `$ npm run build` to build new dist
