# _busy
A to-do list application that overrides the new tab page in your Chrome Browser.
Built using Vue.js 2.0 and Google Firebase for a lightweight backend and Auth.

Built for the sake of learning:
- the ins and outs of developing a single page application with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
- using Node.js as a build tool.
- using npm modules to organize code.
- using other tools minify and concatenate code for deployment.

If you fork:
- Rename `example_config.js` to `config.js` and leave within the `app` directory. Change Firebase credentials as necessary.
- Run `$ npm run dev` for developing.
- Run `$ npm run build` to build new dist.
